									<h1>What is Rails?</h1>
									<p>Rails is a framework based on the Ruby programming language that is used to build web applications. It basically takes multiple languages such as Ruby, HTML, CSS, and Javascript and orchestrates their respective files to manage complex websites. From what I have learned, Rails is widely used for a number of reasons.</p>
									<p>Because of Ruby’s streamlined conventions, programmers can focus more on innovation and development rather than setting up configuration files. In a nutshell, Rails (or Ruby on Rails) has a library that sets defaults for common concepts in programming so that non-productive,  time-consuming work is not necessary. Dry is also a practice used in Rails that prevents duplication. By eliminating redundancies, we create code that is easier to read and prevent possible bugs because we are writing less code.</p>
									<p>Version control is also closely related with the use of Rails. Because of the aforementioned reasons, Rails makes it much easier to collaborate with other programmers. This creates an environment that is beneficial to open source software. Many programmers using Rails use git and Github for version control and management. This enables programmers to save their work in increments, thus making it easier to go back and make changes to code during any phase of the project.</p>
									<p>Last but certainly not least, is the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD). Prior to the use of TDD, many web projects were tested by end-users after the release of the project or by a quality assurance team of programmers. With the use of TDD, programmers begin their development by designing tests that specify what they want their code to do. Once all tests have been written, the development begins. This is important because it locates problems and bugs before releasing the product to end users. It also provides a way for managers to verify that the product performs as specified.</p>
									<p>In researching Rails, I feel that certain concepts in my training have been solidified. It gives me an overall sense of direction when learning different languages and how they are related to each other. I am eager to continue learning and to apply Ruby on Rails in bigger and more complex ways.</p>

									<h4 class="client-name">What is Rails?</h4>

									<h1>From Rags to Glitches...</h1>
									<p>Learning version control was the first hands-on experience for me as far as publishing code. In researching the benefits of version control, I learned that this application makes every programmer's life much easier. While practicing version control using git and GitHub, my understanding of this was reinforced. The bottom line is this; it seems to me that every type of code can potentially be improved. Having a way to record every step you take to modify code makes it much easier to back-track and locate problems.</p>

									<p>Git is the tool we use to do just that. When you learn how to use git, you can try out possible ways to enhance your code without actually changing the original. Once you feel like the code looks or works better, just add, commit, then merge your changes and voila... your code just got that much better. Every time you commit a change, it is logged on git and GitHub. Later, If you notice some bugs or inefficiencies, you can go back to a previous version of your code to make necessary changes.</p>

									<p>What if there is a bug that you can't see? Sometimes when you are too close to a project it's easy to miss things. Or maybe you are aware that your skills are limited and there is always room for improvement. GitHub has you covered. When you commit and push code to GitHub, you allow other programmers to see what you have done and now you have a fresh pair of eyes. Or maybe, you have a team of people working on a large project. Using GitHub, you can keep track of everyone's work and manage it in real time. Having your team member's pull your code before adding it to the master code limits bugs and errors. I'm ready to see what's possible when teaming up with other cohorts and using what we've learned.</p>

									<h1>CSS: The Breakdown</h1>
									<p>
										Learning CSS was bitter sweet. After an overview of what was possible in CSS, I got excited and thought about things I could implement on my own sites. It wasn't long before I realized that making your website look great is not so simple and at times, completely frustrating. I have a new appreciation for beautifully designed sites. For anyone trying to grasp the concepts of CSS, here are a few topics.</p>

										<p>Margins, Borders, Padding! Whats the difference? Imagine a small box with the letters ABC inside of it. The margin simply is the space surrounding that box. It tells you how near or far the box will be separated from other objects. The Border is the edge or line around that box. Usually a visible border is either a solid line(s), dashed line, or dotted. The Padding is the space between the letters in the box and the border. The smaller the letters are in the box, the larger the padding. Simple!</p>

										<p>Classes and ID's: Why?? After writing an extensive HTML page you quickly find that there are many repeating tags or elements. You start to ask yourself "Am I gonna have to style each one of these things individually??" The answer is NO thanks to classes and ID's. Classes are assigned to groups of elements that you want to have the same formatting. Sometimes there is a piece of your HTML that is unique. This is where you would use an ID. So classes can be used to apply styling to many things and ID's are generally used for sporatic things. Got it?</p>

										<p>Positioning! In CSS, there are 4 different types of positions. By default, the positing is Static. This means that your element will be placed as if there is no position assigned. The Absolute position is placed accoring to the first parent that does not have a static position. Relative position just tells the element to go if it had the default static position. The last position is fixed. This just means that the element will stay in it's place in the browser window no matter where you are scrolling. </p>

										<p>Inline Vs Inline-Block. These are 2 types of displays that can come in handy for different reasons. The inline display allows the element to sit on the same line as another element without formatting it like ablock. The inline-block also lets the element sit next to other elements, but it will be in block form.</p>


									</div>
									<div class="item ">
										<h1>Array's and Hashes: What's the Difference??</h1>
										<p>So, you're starting to learn Ruby and everything is going great so far. You know how to loop and understand variables very well. But now, you're learning about data structures and the difference between an array and a hash is kind of blurry. "I get it, arrays and hashes are ways to store sets or a list of data. But when would I use one over the other??" Here's a breakdown of why and when we would use arrays/hashes. </p>

										<p>Let's start with the basics of an array. You can think of an array as just a list. Any time we want to list information in a specific (or non-specific) order we can use an array. The items in that list will be placed in numerical order beginning with 0. For example, if I wanted to list my top 3 favorite movies, I could put ["Contact", "Tombstone", "The Godfather"]. The movie "Contact" would be in placement of 0, "Tombstone" would be 1, and "The Godfather" would be 3. It's as simple is that!</p>

										<p>But what if we wanted to list our favorite movies by genre?? This is where hashes come in handy. With hashes, we can store information using almost anything as key-value pairs. The same information in hash might look like this, "favorite_scifi => 'Contact', favorite_western => 'Tombstone', favorite_drama => 'The Godfather'." So, the key would be our favorite genre and the value would be the movie. Pretty simple right??</p>
