      <h1>Javascript vs Ruby: Hashes or Objects</h1>
      <h2>January 3, 2016</h2>
      <p>Learning Javascript came easier than I thought. This was because we did all the heavy lifting with learning Ruby. It seems to be true that when you learn a programming language, it sets a foundation for learning other languages. I found that many concepts that I learned in Ruby are applicable in Javascript. With that being said, there are also important differences. This purpose of this blog is to elaborate on one of those comparisons: Ruby hashes vs Javascript Objects.</p>
      <p>Conceptually, these two things are the same. The are both variables used to store key/value pairs (or in Javascript, property/value pairs). The difference comes in their syntax and how to access the keys/properties. In Ruby, we define a hash like this: <img src="http://khamla719.github.io/imgs/ruby-hash.png"></p>
      <p>In Javascript, the syntax looks very similar: <img src="http://khamla719.github.io/imgs/jsobject.png"></p>
      <p>There are other ways to define a hash or object in both languages. For the sake of simplicity, these are just one. As you can see, the syntax looks very similar save the 'var' syntax in Javascript and using the colon and hash rockets in Ruby.</p>
      <p>Accessing the keys, or properties, is also a little different. In order to return the value of a key in Ruby we use the following syntax: <img src="http://khamla719.github.io/imgs/ruby-key.png"></p>
      <p>For Javascript, we use the following: <img src="http://khamla719.github.io/imgs/jsprop.png"></p>
      <p>Overall, I have found Javascript to be very similar to Ruby in defining objects and manipulating arrays and hashes. I look forward to finding more ways that they differ and seeing the limitations and benefits of each language.</p>
