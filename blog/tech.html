      <h1>What is Rails?</h1>
      <p>Rails is a framework based on the Ruby programming language that is used to build web applications. It basically takes multiple languages such as Ruby, HTML, CSS, and Javascript and orchestrates their respective files to manage complex websites. From what I have learned, Rails is widely used for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p>Because of Rubyâ€™s streamlined conventions, programmers can focus more on innovation and development rather than setting up configuration files. In a nutshell, Rails (or Ruby on Rails) has a library that sets defaults for common concepts in programming so that non-productive,  time-consuming work is not necessary. Dry is also a practice used in Rails that prevents duplication. By eliminating redundancies, we create code that is easier to read and prevent possible bugs because we are writing less code.</p>
      <p>Version control is also closely related with the use of Rails. Because of the aforementioned reasons, Rails makes it much easier to collaborate with other programmers. This creates an environment that is beneficial to open source software. Many programmers using Rails use git and Github for version control and management. This enables programmers to save their work in increments, thus making it easier to go back and make changes to code during any phase of the project.</p>
      <p>Last but certainly not least, is the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD). Prior to the use of TDD, many web projects were tested by end-users after the release of the project or by a quality assurance team of programmers. With the use of TDD, programmers begin their development by designing tests that specify what they want their code to do. Once all tests have been written, the development begins. This is important because it locates problems and bugs before releasing the product to end users. It also provides a way for managers to verify that the product performs as specified.</p>
      <p>In researching Rails, I feel that certain concepts in my training have been solidified. It gives me an overall sense of direction when learning different languages and how they are related to each other. I am eager to continue learning and to apply Ruby on Rails in bigger and more complex ways.</p>
