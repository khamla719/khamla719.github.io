      <h1 id="blog">Building My ...</h1>
      <p id="blog"><img src="../imgs/website.jpg">Learning to use HTML and CSS has been such a rewarding endeavor. It was definitely much easier to learn than Ruby or Javascript and it also helps when you can see the results of your code in real time. I have enjoyed the overall setup of my website, but I feel that I have not yet learned the tools to fully express myself. As I continue to look at other sites and explore their source code, I find myself incorporating newer ideas to make the site more robust. I am still experience some challenges with sizing certain images and display properties. I learned that building a website requires much care and patience, but well-worth it in the end. </p>
