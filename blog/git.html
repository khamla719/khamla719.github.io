      <h2 id="blog">November 16, 2015</h2>

      <p id="blog"><img src="http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/99/99ba25e5910641574984bc62f2cfffbe3b95af6db401ea62297d3d8d1aea10b2.jpg">Learning version control was the first hands-on experience for me as far as publishing code. In researching the benefits of version control, I learned that this application makes every programmer's life much easier. While practicing version control using git and GitHub, my understanding of this was reinforced. The bottom line is this; it seems to me that every type of code can potentially be improved. Having a way to record every step you take to modify code makes it much easier to back-track and locate problems.</p>

      <p id="blog">Git is the tool we use to do just that. When you learn how to use git, you can try out possible ways to enhance your code without actually changing the original. Once you feel like the code looks or works better, just add, commit, then merge your changes and voila... your code just got that much better. Every time you commit a change, it is logged on git and GitHub. Later, If you notice some bugs or inefficiencies, you can go back to a previous version of your code to make necessary changes.</p>

      <p id="blog">What if there is a bug that you can't see? Sometimes when you are too close to a project it's easy to miss things. Or maybe you are aware that your skills are limited and there is always room for improvement. GitHub has you covered. When you commit and push code to GitHub, you allow other programmers to see what you have done and now you have a fresh pair of eyes. Or maybe, you have a team of people working on a large project. Using GitHub, you can keep track of everyone's work and manage it in real time. Having your team member's pull your code before adding it to the master code limits bugs and errors. I'm ready to see what's possible when teaming up with other cohorts and using what we've learned.</p>
