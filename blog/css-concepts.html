Learning CSS was bitter sweet. After an overview of what was possible in CSS, I got excited and thought about things I could implement on my own sites. It wasn't long before I realized that making your website look great is not so simple and at times, completely frustrating. I have a new appreciation for beautifully designed sites. For anyone trying to grasp the concepts of CSS, here are a few topics.</p>

			<p id="blog">Margins, Borders, Padding! Whats the difference? Imagine a small box with the letters ABC inside of it. The margin simply is the space surrounding that box. It tells you how near or far the box will be separated from other objects. The Border is the edge or line around that box. Usually a visible border is either a solid line(s), dashed line, or dotted. The Padding is the space between the letters in the box and the border. The smaller the letters are in the box, the larger the padding. Simple!</p>

			<p id="blog">Classes and ID's: Why?? After writing an extensive HTML page you quickly find that there are many repeating tags or elements. You start to ask yourself "Am I gonna have to style each one of these things individually??" The answer is NO thanks to classes and ID's. Classes are assigned to groups of elements that you want to have the same formatting. Sometimes there is a piece of your HTML that is unique. This is where you would use an ID. So classes can be used to apply styling to many things and ID's are generally used for sporatic things. Got it?</p>

			<p id="blog">Positioning! In CSS, there are 4 different types of positions. By default, the positing is Static. This means that your element will be placed as if there is no position assigned. The Absolute position is placed accoring to the first parent that does not have a static position. Relative position just tells the element to go if it had the default static position. The last position is fixed. This just means that the element will stay in it's place in the browser window no matter where you are scrolling. </p>

			<p id="blog">Inline Vs Inline-Block. These are 2 types of displays that can come in handy for different reasons. The inline display allows the element to sit on the same line as another element without formatting it like ablock. The inline-block also lets the element sit next to other elements, but it will be in block form.</p>
