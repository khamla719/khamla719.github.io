  <h1>Array's and Hashes: What's the Difference??</h1>

  <p>So, you're starting to learn Ruby and everything is going great so far. You know how to loop and understand variables very well. But now, you're learning about data structures and the difference between an array and a hash is kind of blurry. "I get it, arrays and hashes are ways to store sets or a list of data. But when would I use one over the other??" Here's a breakdown of why and when we would use arrays/hashes. </p>

  <p>Let's start with the basics of an array. You can think of an array as just a list. Any time we want to list information in a specific (or non-specific) order we can use an array. The items in that list will be placed in numerical order beginning with 0. For example, if I wanted to list my top 3 favorite movies, I could put ["Contact", "Tombstone", "The Godfather"]. The movie "Contact" would be in placement of 0, "Tombstone" would be 1, and "The Godfather" would be 3. It's as simple is that!</p>

  <p>But what if we wanted to list our favorite movies by genre?? This is where hashes come in handy. With hashes, we can store information using almost anything as key-value pairs. The same information in hash might look like this, "favorite_scifi => 'Contact', favorite_western => 'Tombstone', favorite_drama => 'The Godfather'." So, the key would be our favorite genre and the value would be the movie. Pretty simple right??</p>
