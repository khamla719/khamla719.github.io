How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  - It was fun to see the creative process of someone from a completely different background. The approach that she took inspired me to explore things that I never previously considered when designing a page.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  - Wireframing was definitely helpful to my development process. I am a visual oriented person and being able to see the pages before actually styling it or adding text gave me great ideas on where to go next.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  - Even though we decided to go with different layouts, we discussed many things that made a good wireframe. Of course, keeping it simple was first and foremost, but we also drew inspiration from previous blogs we visited. We made sure that all necessary navigational controls were included. We specified where the blog title, body, and any images were to be located.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
