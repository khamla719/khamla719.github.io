    <p> <img id="about" src="imgs/about.JPG" align="left">My name is Khamla Phimmachack and my goal is to create simple things that have a profound effect.</p>
    <p>I know what you're thinking... "Easier said than done." While this may be true, I have found that many aspirations start simple, then quickly become unnecessarily complex. The ability to identify futile ambitions and replace them with effort and innovation has become an invaluable part of my approach. </p>

  <h2>Inspirations</h2>
    <p>My first love has always been music. For every milestone in life, there is a song or melody that best conveys every emotion I ever felt. Music has been a mirror for my soul, casting light on the deepest places obscure from the naked eye and allowing me to reflect on who I am, was, and want to be. Tech innovation has also opened the doors of my imagination, challenging me to perpetuate self-growth amidst incredible odds. But, my deepest inspiration was bestowed upon me when I met the love of my life. She precedes every ambition and is the very definition of my life's work. </p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>To be different has always been a privilege for me. The second language I learned taught me that major disagreements leave breadcrumbs to minor miscommunication. Being involved in two religions at a young age allowed me to appreciate the good deeds of others and at the same time cherish my lack of need for one. I served tables, sold clothing, answered phones, built teams, managed businesses, and cultivated plants. Now I am learning to cultivate meaningful web applications and I'm constantly fascinated by the organic nature of the process. As a consequence of each chapter in life, I have acquired the ability to refine the relationship with myself, my loved ones, and my community. This is the approach I take to web development.</p>
