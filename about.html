<h1>A Little About Me</h1>
  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
    <p>My family and I moved here from Laos in 1986. I was a little more than 2 years old, so I basically grew up in the States. We made our home in Chattanooga, TN and it's a place that I still call home. I feel I was lucky being a refugee from southeast Asia and growing up in a small city in the South. I learned to appreciate the compassion and community of a small town.</p>

  <h2>Interest/Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My first love has always been music, even though I don't have much talent. Music always helped me assimilate when I felt like an outcast. It was the ultimate ice-breaker for getting to know people. When I was 12, my mother bought us our first Gateway PC. Even though we were poor refugees, my parents understood the value of having their children be computer literate. This was my second love. I spent hours online, doing mostly silly things, but it soon became apparent that technology occupied a major part of my life. While living in Hawaii, I adopted an insatiable passion for surfing. It was the hardest hobby I have ever tried, and also one of the most rewarding.</p>

  <h2>Education/Experience</h2>
    <p>I graduated from high school in 2002 and attempted the college route, as everyone expected of me. After struggling for a few years, I realized that I was not the right person at the time to pursue a college degree. Some people just learn the hard way and that was me. I started working customer service for a major health insurance company and was promoted 3 times within 4 years. Eventually, I wanted to pursue other career fields so I tried marketing and sales. This opened my eyes to a whole different perspective about my life and the career I wanted to pursue. The skills I learned from marketing ultimately led me to manage my parents restaurant. But, I could never shake my passion for technology and that is why I learned to code</p>

  <h2>Quirks</h2>
    <p>I don't think I have many quirks, but my wife tells me that I talk alot. I have such a passion for communication and sometimes I get carried away discussing an interest. Sometimes I get so far off a tangent that I forget the original point I was trying to make. I also LOVE singing in the shower... It's therapeutic.</p>
