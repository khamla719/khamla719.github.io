Objective
Build a responsive, single-page or multi-section personal portfolio that highlights your 4+ years as a Customer-centric Support Engineer, showcases your skills, projects, and professional journey—and does so with cutting-edge UX/UI (gradients, glassmorphism, micro-animations).

Audience & Goals
Primary audience: Hiring managers and technical leads at B2B SaaS companies.

Secondary audience: Recruiters, peers, and open-source/community collaborators.

Goals:

Immediately communicate your troubleshooting prowess and B2B SaaS background.

Make it easy to scan skills, experience, education, and projects.

Encourage contact (via form or mailto) and LinkedIn resume download.

Visual Style & Interaction
Color & Texture:

Soft, muted base palette with vibrant gradient highlights (e.g., teal→blue, violet→pink).

Glassmorphic “cards” for sections: translucent backgrounds, subtle blur, border accents.

Typography:

Clean, geometric sans-serif (e.g., Inter or Poppins).

Distinct weight hierarchy (e.g., 600 for headings, 400 for body).

Animations & Micro-Interactions:

Entrance animations: Fade/slide for each section as user scrolls.

Hover states: Smooth scale or color-shift on buttons, card lifts with soft shadow.

Scroll effects: Parallax backgrounds or subtle skew on hero image.

Progress indicators: Animated “skill bars” or circular charts that fill on view.

Dark mode toggle: With smooth transition of colors/glassmorphism.

Structure & Content
Hero Section

Headline: “Hi, I’m [Name]—Customer-centric Support Engineer”

Subhead: “4+ years in B2B SaaS troubleshooting, integrations & custom code.”

Visual: Illustration or abstract SVG with gradient overlay and a subtle parallax.

Call to Action: “Download Résumé” & “Contact Me” buttons.
